# voice_note_to_text

A new Flutter project.

This application will serve to take whatsapp voice notes, and transcribe them into text for your ease of use.

## The Speech to Text

I'll be making use of one of my other projects for the [Speech to Text](https://github.com/IsaiahSama/SpeechToTextAPI). 

Currently testing, so will have it on localhost, but will eventuallly publish it so it works from mobile devices.

Note: The application **REQUIRES** a server to handle the transcription.

For now, it's set to look for localhost on port 5000, having been built to work with my other project, but the code and endpoint can be changed.
